# Programming assignment 2: Perceptron

Using the training data provided in the file pa2_input.txt in Materials, find the optimal weights for a sigmoid perceptron-like classifier described in this tutorial: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Christof93/perceptron/blob/master/perceptron_algorithm.ipynb

To solve this task, you need to understand how to:
1. Initialise the weights (e.g. how many you need)
2. Calculate the output
3. Calculate the error
4. Update the weights as a function of the error (use the same formula as in the tutorial)
5. Define the stopping criterion


## Submit to OLAT:
1. your python code named pa2.py
2. your weights as a text file, one number per line, named weights_pa2.txt
